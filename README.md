Implemented Different Classifiers to predict the Exercise based on the physical terminal poses of the excercise

Classifiers implemented:
- Logisitc Regression
- XGBoost Classifier
- Decision Tree
- Random Forests

About Dataset

This dataset represents 10 different physical poses that can be used to distinguish 5 exercises. The exercises are Push-up, Pull-up, Sit-up, Jumping Jack and Squat. For every exercise, 2 different classes have been used to represent the terminal positions of that exercise (e.g., “up” and “down” positions for push-ups).
